# Summary of Important Hashing Patterns for Problem solving

- **Frequency Counting:** Use hash maps to count occurrences (e.g., finding the first unique character).
- **Existence Check:** Use hash maps for fast lookup and checking if a value exists (e.g., finding pairs that sum to a target).
- **Grouping:** Use hash maps to group data based on a key (e.g., grouping anagrams).
- Substring Search: Use rolling hash or other hashing techniques for efficient string matching.
- Collision Handling: Understand how hash tables handle collisions through separate chaining or open addressing (internal hash table mechanics).
- **One Pass solution:** The algorithm makes a single traversal or iteration over the data to achieve the result. (e.g **Two sum** & **Isomorphic Strings**).
- **two-pass solution:** The algorithm makes exactly two independent traversals over the data. (e.g Set Mismatch)
- **O(n) Spaced Complexity Approach**
