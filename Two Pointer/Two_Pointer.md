# Two Pointer

## Summary of Important Two Pointer Patterns

- Two Pointers for Pair/Matching Problems where Left (From index 0) and right (From index arr.length-1) pointers are typically used in sorted arrays to check pairs or compute values based on comparisons but for unsorted we can use hashing for better time complexity.
  
- Subsequence problems can be solved with two pointers by moving through both the sequence and the potential subsequence and checking for matches.

- Sliding window problems use two pointers to expand and contract a window efficiently.

- Partitioning/Swapping: Used for problems like 3-way partitioning or moving elements based on conditions (e.g., Dutch National Flag Problem)
