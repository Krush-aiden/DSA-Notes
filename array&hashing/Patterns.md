# Summary of Important Hashing Patterns for Problem solving

- Frequency Counting: Use hash maps to count occurrences (e.g., finding the first unique character).
- Existence Check: Use hash maps for fast lookup and checking if a value exists (e.g., finding pairs that sum to a target).
- Grouping: Use hash maps to group data based on a key (e.g., grouping anagrams).
- Substring Search: Use rolling hash or other hashing techniques for efficient string matching.
- Collision Handling: Understand how hash tables handle collisions through separate chaining or open addressing (internal hash table mechanics).
